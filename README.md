# Basic-Website-Template-CSS-HTML-
So, this is basically how i start working on any website (for school)
I just copy this and use it as a baseplate.
the index has a bit of code wich you can remove. (everything after head)
It contains 3 folders and 3 files,
You can change the language at the top no problem.
Please if you use this template treat it kindly, i dont need credit for this for it is not difficult to make anything like this.
